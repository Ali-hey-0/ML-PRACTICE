## Introduction

This repository is intended for practicing and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and techniques. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ali-hey-0/ML-PRACTICE.git
    ```
2. Change to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd ML-PRACTICE
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start using the Jupyter Notebooks, run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
